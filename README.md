The Google Tasks Bookmarklet is an easy way to add a task to your Google Tasks list
from any webpage.

Originally I created https://github.com/geoff604/google-tasks-bookmarklet
which was based on Google Apps Script, but it seems like Google Apps Script is no longer supported.

So I created a PHP version of the bookmarklet here.

Note: It is recommended to protect the php files via Apache Basic Authentication since it may be a
security risk if you put the files on your site without any password.
